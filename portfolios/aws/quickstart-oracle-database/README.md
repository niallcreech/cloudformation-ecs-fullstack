# quickstart-oracle-database

This Quick Start provides a reliable and automated way to install and configure Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition on AWS with high availability.

The Quick Start deploys Oracle Database into a Multi-AZ configuration on AWS with asynchronous data replication between Availability Zones. You can choose to deploy Oracle Database into a new or your existing AWS environment, and use Oracle Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The Quick Start templates install Oracle ASM for storage management, and Oracle Data Guard for database setup and replication. You can also include the Oracle Secure Backup (OSB) Cloud Module for backups.
